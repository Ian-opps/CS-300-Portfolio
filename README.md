# CS-300 Portfolio: Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository showcases key projects from my CS-300 course, highlighting my understanding of data structures, algorithm design, and software development practices.

## 📁 Included Files

- `ProjectOne_Analysis.md`: Analysis of runtime and memory usage for various data structures used in Project One.
- `ProjectTwo.cpp`: Working code that sorts and prints a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order.

## 🧠 Reflection

In these projects, I tackled two core challenges: analyzing the efficiency of data structures and implementing a sorting algorithm to organize course data. I approached each problem by first identifying the requirements and selecting the most appropriate structures—such as using a binary search tree for fast lookup and insertion. Understanding how data structures impact performance helped me make informed design decisions.

Throughout the course, I encountered roadblocks like file naming conflicts and runtime errors. I overcame these by iterating through test cases, refining my folder structure, and confirming output formats against rubric expectations. These experiences sharpened my troubleshooting skills and taught me the value of modular, well-commented code.

This project expanded my mindset from simply “getting it to work” to designing software that’s maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I now write programs with future reuse in mind—using consistent naming, separating logic into functions, and anticipating edge cases. These habits will serve me well in both academic and professional environments.
